        <h1>Statement of Significance</h1>
        <dl>
            <dt>Churchill House is a good example of the Late Twentieth Century Brutalist style, displaying several key features as follows:</dt>
                <dd>- Large areas of blank wall, especially the west wall of the south wing.</dd>
                <dd>- Off-form concrete, such as the west wall of the south wing and the spandrels to the south and east wings.</dd>
        </dl>
        <img src="assets/images/statementofsignificance1.jpg" alt="Churchill House sketch">
        <p>In addition, it displays a number of the other features of this style including: sloping structural fins, precast concrete non-loadbearing wall panels, precast fins for sun protection, and vertical slit windows. Churchill House is one of several Canberra examples of this style, and one of only two which display a restrained form reflecting, perhaps, a more conservative approach to the style because of the intended office use.</p>
        <p>The architecture of this building may contribute to the education of designers in their understanding of Late Twentieth-Century Architectural Styles.</p>
        <p>Churchill House has interest for its association with the prominent architect, Robin Boyd. The building was his last major commission.</p>
